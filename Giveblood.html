        <hr/>
    <p>Most people can give blood if they are in good health. There are some basic requirements one  need to fulfill in order to become a blood donor.  Below are some basic eligibility guidelines:</p>
    <h2>Age:</h2>
    <p>You are aged between 18 and 65.</p>

       <p> * In some countries national legislation permits 16–17 year-olds to donate provided that they fulfil the physical and hematological criteria required and that appropriate consent is obtained.</p>
        
        <p>* In some countries, regular donors over the age of 65 may be accepted at the discretion of the responsible physician. The upper age limit in some countries are 60.</p>

        <h2>Weight:</h2>

        <p>* You weigh at least 50 kg.</p>    
        
       <p> * In some countries, donors of whole blood donations should weigh at least 45 kg to donate 350 ml ± 10% .</p>

       <h2>Health:</h2>      

<p>You must be in good health at the time you donate.</p>

<p>*You cannot donate if you have a cold, flu, sore throat, cold sore, stomach bug or any other infection.</p>

<p>*If you have recently had a tattoo or body piercing you cannot donate for 6 months from the date of the procedure.  If the body piercing was performed by a registered health professional and any inflammation has settled completely, you can donate blood after 12 hours.</p>

<p>*If you have visited the dentist for a minor procedure you must wait 24 hours before donating; for major work wait a month.</p>

<p>*You must not donate blood If you do not meet the minimum haemoglobin level for blood donation</p>

<p>* A test will be administered at the donation site. In many countries, a haemoglobin level of not less than 12.0 g/dl for females and not less than 13.0 g/dl for males as the threshold.</p>
