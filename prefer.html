    <p>When you bring someone along to donate blood, you get more than just companionship—you also get more money! CTLS has a referral program, where you earn a bonus for every new donor you bring in. If your friend donates whole blood or white blood cells, you’ll get £10 Amazon e-card. And this bonus is in addition to the money that you both receive for your donations.

Maybe after your blood donation, you can use some of your referral bonus to treat your friend to a snack or a gift to say thank you!
